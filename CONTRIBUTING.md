===========================

Thank you for taking your time an trying to contribute to DBoard! All contributions are very much welcome.  
All you need to do is fork this repo and submit a PR. Please consider the following:
* It's hard to review big changes. So if you're submitting a PR, please keep it small.
* It's hard to review big changes. So please don't rewrite the entire app from scratch. If you have anything to add that requires changes, let's start by building on top of what's already working.
* Please test that the app can be built.
* Please try to follow common sense in codestyle. D-style is a good beginning!

If you can't write code, any issues or suggestions are greatly appreciated as well!
